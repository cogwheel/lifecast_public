# Lifecast Inc. Open Source

Lifecast makes software for immersive volumetric VR videos and photos. Lifecast's 6DOF format for 3D photos and videos can be generated using tools available on https://lifecastvr.com. This repo hosts the player for this format, which is open source under the MIT license. Several implementations of the player are available, in javascript, Unity and Unreal Engine.
